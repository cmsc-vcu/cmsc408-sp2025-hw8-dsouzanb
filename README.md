# CMSC408  - Homework 8 - Spring 2025

## Project Description

In this assignment, we explored global development data from the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. The focus was on writing efficient SQL queries to extract insights about countries, income levels, and regions. By analyzing the structure and content of a large dataset, we practiced grouping, filtering, aggregating, and joining tables to answer meaningful development-related questions. This project built our skills in data analysis using SQL in a real-world context.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to simulate working with real-world data used by organizations like the World Bank. These types of datasets help monitor development, economic trends, and regional disparities across the globe. Understanding how to interact with large, relational databases prepares us for practical tasks like analyzing public datasets, building dashboards, or supporting policy decisions.

### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to strengthen our understanding of SQL for data analysis. It required us to examine the relationships between countries, regions, and income groups, and then write queries that grouped, joined, and aggregated data in meaningful ways. The project helps us understand how data structures support complex analysis and how SQL can be used to turn raw data into actionable insights.

### Features 

- **Data Exploration**: A detailed walk-through of regional and income-based analysis using WDI data.

- **Advanced SQL Practice**: Heavy use of grouping, joining, subqueries, and case-based pivot tables.

- **Reflection**: A reflective section to think through challenges and learning moments from querying complex real-world datasets.
